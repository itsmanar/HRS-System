# HRS-System
HR System for a company 
HRS is a Human Resources Solutions system, that provides a platform to manage the hiring process of 
a group of qualified cleaning-workers and drivers on an hourly basis. The HRS management system will 
begin with 10 employees (cleaning-workers and drivers). However, as a future plan, it will be expanded 
to reach 100 employeesâ€™ records.
